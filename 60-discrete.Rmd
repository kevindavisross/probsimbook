Discrete random variables take at most countably many possible values (e.g., $0, 1, 2, \ldots$).  They are often counting variables (e.g., the number of Heads in 10 coin flips).

The probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete random variable $X$, defined on a probability space with probability measure $\IP$, is a function $p_X:\mathbb{R}\mapsto[0,1]$ which specifies each possible value of the RV and the probability that the RV takes that particular value: $p_X(x)=\IP(X=x)$ for each possible value of $x$.


The axioms of probability imply that a valid pmf must satisfy
\begin{align*}
p_X(x) & \ge 0 \quad \text{for all $x$}\\
p_X(x) & >0 \quad \text{for at most countably many $x$ (the possible values, i.e., support)}\\
\sum_x p_X(x) & = 1
\end{align*}

The countable set of possible values of a discrete random variable $X$, $\{x: p_X(x)>0\}$, is called its **support**.

In this section we study some commonly used discrete distributions and their properties.  When developing a probability model for a random process, certain assumptions are made about the process or the distribution of a corresponding RV.  Some situations are so common that the corresponding distributions have special names.



## Hypergeometric distributions {#hyper}



```{example, capture}
Capture-recapture sampling is a technique often used to estimate the size of a population.  Suppose you want to estimate $N$, the number of [monarch butterflies in Pismo Beach](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30273).  (Assume that $N$ is a fixed but unknown number; the population size doesn't change over time.) You first capture a sample of $N_1$ butterflies, selected randomly without replacement, and tag them and release them.  At a later date, you then capture a second sample of $n$ butterflies, selected randomly *without* replacement.  Let $X$ be the number of butterflies in the second sample that have tags (because they were also caught in the first sample).  (Assume that the tagging has no effect on behavior, so that selection in the first sample is independent of selection in the second sample.)

In practice, $N$ is unknown.  But let's start with a simpler, but unrealistic, example where there are $N=52$ butterflies, $N_1 = 13$ are tagged in the first sample, and $n=5$ is the size of the second sample.

```

1. Are the five individual selections independent?
1. What are the possible values of $X$?
1. Describe in detail how you could use simulation to approximate the distribution of $X$.
1. Find $\IP(X = 0)$ in two ways.
1. Find the probability that in the second sample the first butterfly selected is tagged but the rest are not.
1. Find the probability that in the second sample the first four butterflies selected are not tagged but the fifth is.
1. Find $\IP(X = 1)$ in two ways.
1. Find $\IP(X = 2)$ in two ways.
1. Suggest a formula for the probability mass function of $X$.
1. Find $\E(X)$ and suggest a simple shortcut formula.
1. It can be shown that $\Var(X) = 0.864$. Would the variance be greater, less, or the same if the sampling was with replacement rather than without?


```{solution capture-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:capture)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. No. When sampling without replacement the individual selections are not independent. For example, the conditional probability that the second butterfly is tagged given that the first is tagged is 12/51, but the conditional probability that the second butterfly is tagged given that the first is not tagged is 13/51. 
1. $X$ can take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1. Write 1 to represent "tagged" on 13 cards and 0 to represent "not tagged" on 39 cards.  Shuffle the 52 cards and deal 5, and let $X$ be the number of cards in the 5 dealt that are labeled 1 ("tagged").  Repeat many times to simulate many values of $X$.  Approximate $\IP(X = x)$ with the simulated relative frequency for $x = 0, 1, \ldots, 5$.  For example, count the number of repetitions in which $X$ is 2 and divide by the total number of repetitions to approximate $\IP(X = 2)$.
1. We can use the partitioning strategy from the previous section.
\[
\IP(X = 0) = \frac{\binom{13}{0}\binom{39}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}  = 0.2215
\]
We can also use the multiplication rule.  The probability that the first butterfly selected is not tagged is 39/52.  Given that the first is not tagged, the conditional probability that the second butterfly selected is not tagged is $38/51$.  Given that the first two butterflies selected are not tagged, the conditional probability that the third butterfly selected is not tagged is $37/50$. And so on.  The probability that none of the butterflies selected are tagged is
\[
\IP(X = 0) = \left(\frac{39}{52}\right)\left(\frac{38}{51}\right)\left(\frac{37}{50}\right)\left(\frac{36}{49}\right)\left(\frac{35}{48}\right) = 0.2215
\]
The two methods are equivalent.
1. We can use the multiplication rule.  The probability that the first butterfly selected is tagged is 13/52.  Given that the first is tagged, the conditional probability that the second butterfly selected is not tagged is $39/51$.  Given that the first is tagged and the second is not, the conditional probability that the third butterfly selected is not tagged is $38/50$. And so on.  The probability in question is
\[
\left(\frac{13}{52}\right)\left(\frac{39}{51}\right)\left(\frac{38}{50}\right)\left(\frac{37}{49}\right)\left(\frac{36}{48}\right) = 0.0823
\]
1. We can use the multiplication rule.  The probability that the first butterfly selected is not tagged is 39/52.  Given that the first is not tagged, the conditional probability that the second butterfly selected is not tagged is $38/51$.  And so on.  Given that the first four selected are not tagged, the probability that the fifth butterfly selected is tagged is 13/48. The probability in question is
\[
\left(\frac{39}{52}\right)\left(\frac{38}{51}\right)\left(\frac{37}{50}\right)\left(\frac{36}{49}\right)\left(\frac{13}{48}\right) = 0.0823
\]
This is the same probability in the previous part.
1. Continuing with the two previous parts, the probability of any particular sequence with exactly one tagged butterfly is 0.0823.  There are $\binom{5}{1}=5$ such sequences, since there are 5 "spots" where the one tagged butterfly could be (first selected through fifth selected).  Therefore
\[
\IP(X = 1) = \binom{5}{1}\left(\frac{13}{52}\right)\left(\frac{39}{51}\right)\left(\frac{38}{50}\right)\left(\frac{37}{49}\right)\left(\frac{36}{48}\right) = 0.4114.
\]
We can also use the partitioning strategy.
\[
\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{39}{4}}{\binom{52}{5}}  = 0.4114.
\]
The two methods are equivalent.
1. Similar to the previous part. Multiplication rule
\[
\IP(X = 2) = \binom{5}{2}\left(\frac{13}{52}\right)\left(\frac{12}{51}\right)\left(\frac{39}{50}\right)\left(\frac{38}{49}\right)\left(\frac{37}{48}\right) = 0.2743.
\]
Partitioning
\[
\IP(X = 2) = \frac{\binom{13}{2}\binom{39}{3}}{\binom{52}{5}}  = 0.2743.
\]
1. The partitioning method provides a more compact expression. In order to have a sample of size 5 with exactly $x$ tagged butterflies, we need to select $x$ butterflies from the 13 tagged butterflies in the population, and the remaining $5-x$ butterflies from the 39 untagged butterflies in the population.
\[
p_X(x) = \frac{\binom{13}{x}\binom{39}{5-x}}{\binom{52}{5}}, \qquad x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
\]
1. We could find the distribution and use the definition of expected value.  However, we can also write $X$ as a sum of indicators and use linearity of expected value.  For $i=1, \ldots, 5$, let $X_i$ be 1 if the $i$th butterfly selected is tagged, and let $X_i$ be 0 otherwise. Then $X=X_1+\cdots+X_5$.  $\E(X_i)$ is the *unconditional* probability that the $i$th butterfly selected is tagged, which is 13/52.  Therefore, $\E(X) = 5(13/52) = 1.25$.  This makes sense: if 1/4 of the butterflies in the population are tagged, we would also expect 1/4 of the butterflies in a randomly selected sample to be tagged.
1. The variance be greater if the sampling was with replacement.  Sampling without replacement, each selection conditionally restricts the number of possibilities, allowing for less variability in the number of successes in the sample.  For example, sampling with replacement yields a slightly larger probability for $\{X=5\}$ than sampling without replacement does.

    As a more extreme example, suppose instead that the sample size was $n=20$.  Then, the largest possible value of $X$ is 13 when sampling without replacement but 20 when sampling with replacement.

``` 

```{python, sym-cards-hyper}

P = BoxModel({1: 13, 0: 39}, size = 5, replace = False)
X = RV(P, count_eq(1))
x = X.sim(10000)

x.plot()
Hypergeometric(N1 = 13, N0 = 39, n = 5).plot()
plt.show()

```

```{python}

x.count_eq(2) / 10000, Hypergeometric(N1 = 13, N0 = 39, n = 5).pmf(2)

```



```{python}

x.mean(), Hypergeometric(N1 = 13, N0 = 39, n = 5).mean()

```


```{python}

x.var(), Hypergeometric(N1 = 13, N0 = 39, n = 5).var()

```


```{definition, hypergeometric}

A discrete random variable $X$ has a **Hypergeometric distribution** with parameters
$n, N_0, N_1$, all nonnegative integers --- with $N = N_0+N_1$ and $p=N_1/N$ --- if its probability mass function is

\begin{align*}
p_{X}(x) & = \frac{\binom{N_1}{x}\binom{N_0}{n-x}}{\binom{N_0+N_1}{n}},\quad  x \in \{\max(n-N_0,0),\ldots,\min(n,N_1)\}\\
\end{align*}
If $X$ has a Hypergeometric($n$, $N_1$, $N_0$) distribution
\begin{align*}
\E(X) & = np\\
\Var(X) & = np(1-p)\left(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\right)
\end{align*}

```

Imagine a box containing $N=N_1+N_0$ tickets, $N_1$ of which are labeled 1 ("success") and
$N_0$ of which are labeled 0 ("failure").  Randomly select $n$ tickets from the box *without replacement* and let $X$ be the number of tickets in the sample that are labeled 1. Then $X$ has a Hypergeometric($N_1$, $N_0$, $n$) distribution.  Since the tickets are labeled 1 and 0, the random variable $X$ which counts the number of successes is equal to the sum of the 1/0 values on the tickets.

The population size is $N$ and the sample size is $n$. The population proportion of success is $p=N_1/N$.  The random variable $X$ counts the number of successes in the sample, and so $X/n$ is the sample proportion of success. However, since the selections are made without replacement, the draws are not independent, and it is not enough to just specify $p$ to determine the distribution of $X$ (or $X/n$).


The largest possible value of $X$ is $\min(n, N_1)$, since there can't be more successes in the sample than in the population. The smallest possible value of $X$ is $\max(0, n-N_0)$ since there can't be more failures in the sample than in the population (that is, $n-X\le N_0$). Often $N_0$ and $N_1$ are large relative to $n$ in which case $X$ takes
values $0, 1,\ldots, n$.

The quantity $\frac{N-n}{N-1}<1$ which appears in the variance formula is called the *finite population
correction*.  We will investigate this factor in more detail later.

<!-- residents. Select a SRS of 100 Cal Poly undergrads, and let $X$ be the -->

<!-- Compute the probability that there are at exactly 80 CA residents in the -->

## Binomial distributions {#binomial}


We introduced Binomial distributions in Section \@ref(sec-binomial).
Now we'll study Binomial distributions in more detail.
Our first example is just to remind us of situations where Binomial distributions arise.


```{example binomial-stock}
Consider an extremely simplified model for the daily closing price of a certain stock.
Every day the price either goes up or goes down, and the movements are independent from day-to-day.
Assume that the probability that the stock price goes up on any single day is 0.25.
Let $X$ be the *number* of days in which the price goes up in the next 5 days.
```

1. Compute and interpret $\IP(X=5)$.
1. Compute the probability that the price goes up on the next three days and then down on the following two days.
1. Compute and interpret $\IP(X=3)$.  Why is $\IP(X=3)$ different from the probability in the previous part?
1. Suggest a general formula for the probability mass function of $X$.
1. Use the pmf of $X$ to construct a table, plot, and spinner of the distribution of $X$.
1. Suggest a "shortcut" formula for $\E(X)$.  Then use the table from the previous part to compute $\E(X)$.  Did the shortcut formula work? Interpret $\E(X)$.
1. Is the random variable $X$ in this problem the same random variable as the random variable $X$ in \@ref(exm:binomial-capture)?
1. Does the random variable $X$ in this problem have the same distribution the random variable $X$ in \@ref(exm:binomial-capture)?


```{solution binomial-stock-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:binomial-stock)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}
1. Days are independent so we can multiply probabilities
$$
\IP(X = 5) = (0.25)(0.25)(0.25)(0.25)(0.25) = (0.25)^5 = \binom{5}{5}(0.25)^5(1-0.25)^{5 -5} = 0.00098
$$
In about 0.098\% of 5-day periods the price goes up all 5 days.
1. Days are independent so we can multiply probabilities
$$
(0.25)(0.25)(0.25)(1-0.25)(1-0.25) = (0.25)^3(1-0.25)^{5-3} = 0.0088
$$
1. SSSFF is only one outcome with $X=3$.  There are $\binom{5}{3}=10$ total outcomes for which $X = 3$, each with probability $(0.25)^3(1-0.25)^2$, so 
$$
\IP(X = 3) = 10(0.25)^3(1-0.25)^2 = \binom{5}{3}(0.25)^3(1-0.25)^{5-3} = 0.088
$$
In about 8.8\% of 5-day periods the price goes up on exactly 3 of the 5 days.
1. The pmf is
$$
p(x) = 
\begin{cases}
	\binom{5}{x} 0.25^x (1-0.25)^{5-x}, & x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\
	0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
1. See Example \@ref(exm:binomial-capture) and the discussion following it.
1. If price goes up on 25\% of days we would expect $5(0.25) = 1.25$ up movements in 5 days, on average in the long run.
This is what we get if we compute the expected value the "long way" based on the distribution table.
1. These are different random variables. The number of tagged butterflies is different than the number of up price movements.
1. Yes, they have the same distribution. While the contexts are different and the variables are measuring different things, probabilistically the situations are equivalent.
In each situation:
    - There are S/F trials (tagged/not, up/not)
    - Trials are independent (sampling with replacement, by assumption)
    - Probability of success of 0.25 on each trial (13/52, assumed 0.25)
    - 5 trials (5 butterflies,  5 days)
    - $X$ counts the number of successes (number of tagged butterflies, number of up movements)
Therefore, in each problem the random variable $X$ has a Binomial(5, 0.25) distribution.
```

A discrete random variable $X$ has a **Binomial distribution** with parameters
$n$, a nonnegative integer, and $p\in[0, 1]$ if its probability mass function is
\begin{align*}
p_{X}(x) & = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}, & x=0, 1, 2, \ldots, n
\end{align*}
If $X$ has a Binomial($n$, $p$) distribution
\begin{align*}
\E(X) & = np\\
\Var(X) & = np(1-p)
\end{align*}

```

Imagine a box containing tickets with $p$ representing the proportion of tickets in the box labeled 1 ("success"); the rest are labeled 0 ("failure").  Randomly select $n$ tickets from the box *with replacement* and let $X$ be the number of tickets in the sample that are labeled 1. Then $X$ has a Binomial($n$, $p$) distribution.  Since the tickets are labeled 1 and 0, the random variable $X$ which counts the number of successes is equal to the sum of the 1/0 values on the tickets. If the selections are made with replacement, the draws are independent, so it is enough to just specify the population proportion $p$ without knowing the population size $N$.



The situation in the previous paragraph and example involves a sequence of **Bernoulli trials**.

- There are only two possible outcomes, "success" (1) and "failure" (0), on each trial.
- The unconditional/marginal probability of success is the same on every trial, and equal to $p$
- The trials are independent.

If $X$ counts the number of successes in a *fixed number*, $n$, of Bernoulli($p$) trials then $X$ has a Binomial($n, p$) distribution.  
Careful: Don't confuse the number $p$, the probability of success on any single trial, with the probability mass function $p_X(\cdot)$ which takes as an input a number $x$ and returns as an output the probability of $x$ successes in $n$ Bernoulli($p$) trials, $p_X(x)=\IP(X=x)$.

1. What does the random variable $5-X$ represent?  What is its distribution?
1. Suppose that the price is currently $100 and each it either moves up $2 or down $2.  Let $S$ be the stock price after 5 days.  How does $S$ relate to $X$?  Does $S$ have a Binomial distribution?
1.  Recall that $X$ is the number of days on which the price goes up in the next five days. Suppose that $Y$ is the number of days on which the price goes up in the ten days after that (days 6-15).  What is the distribution of $X+Y$? (Continue to assume independence between days, with probability 0.25 of an up movement on any day.)


```{solution binomial-stock2-sol}

```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. Since on each day the price either moves up or down, if $X$ is the number of days the price moves up, then $5-X$ is the number of days the price moves down.  $5-X$ counts down days, so just change the "success/failure" labels; now "success" is down, and the probability of down on any single day is 0.75.  So the distribution of $5-X$ is Binomial(5, 0.75).
1. $S = 100 + 2X -2(5-X) = 4X + 90$.  $S$ is a linear rescaling, so it doesn't change the basic shape of the distribution.  *However*, technically $S$ does *not* have a Binomial distribution, because the possible values of a variable with a Binomial distribution are always $0, 1, \ldots, n$.  The distribution of $S$ is like a "rescaled" Binomial distribution.
1. $X+Y$ is the total number of up days in the 15 days. The Binomial situation is still satisfied, but now with $n=15$, so $X+Y$ has a Binomial(15, 0.25) distribution.

1. Yes, Binomial(20, 0.5). Success = even.

1. Not Binomial; not a fixed number of trials. These are Bernoulli trials, but the random variable is not counting the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
1. Not Binomial; each trial has more outcomes than just success or failure, and the random variable is summing the values rather than counting successes.
1. Not Binomial, because the trials are not independent.  The conditional probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card is a heart is 12/51, which is not equal to the conditional probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card is not a heart, 13/51.  The trials are not independent.  However, *the unconditional probability of success is the same on each trial*, $p=13/52$.  Recall Section \@ref(conditional-versus-unconditional).
1. Not Binomial.  Here the trials are independent, but the probability of success is not the same on each trial; it's 1/6 for the six-sided die trials but 1/4 for the four sided-die trials. 


```

Do not confuse the following two distinct assumptions of Bernoulli trials.

- The probability of success is the same on each trial --- this concerns the *unconditional/marginal* probability of each individual trial.
    - The probability of success will be the same on each trial regardless of whether the sampling is with or without replacement as long as all trials are sampled from the same population.
- The trials are independent --- this concerns *joint or conditional* probabilities for the collection of trials.
    - The trials will technically only be independent if the sampling is with replacement.
    - But when sampling without replacement, if the population size is much larger than the sample size then the trials will be nearly independent.

```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

For a Binomial($n$, $p$) distribution, variance increases as $n$ increases.
Since the possible values of a random variable with a Binomial distribution are $0, 1, \ldots, n$, as $n$ increases the range of possible values of the variable increases.

However, in some sense it is unfair to compare values from Binomial distributions with different values of $n$.
Ten successes has a very different meaning if $n$ is 10 or 20 or 100. Rather than focusing on the absolute number of successes, in Binomial situations we are often concerned with the *proportion* of successes in the sample.
We will see soon that as the sample size $n$ increases, the variance of the sample proportion decreases.

The distribution is most disperse, and the variance largest, when $p=0.5$.
When $p=0.5$ we would expect the most "alterations" between success and failure in the individual trials.

Variance decreases as $p$ moves away from 0.5.
That is, variance decreases as $p$ gets closer to 0 or 1.
The variance when $p=0.3$ appears to be the same as when $p=0.7$, and similarly for $p=0.1$ and $p=0.9$.
For the extreme case $p=0$, every trials results in failure so the number of successes is always 0 and the variance is 0.
Likewise, when $p=1$ every trials results in success so the number of successes is always $n$, and the variance is 0.


```


The previous exercises provide an intuitive explanation of the formula for the variance of a Binomial distribution: $\Var(X) = np(1-p)$.
The formula can be derived using indicators and the fact that a sum of *independent* random variables is the sum of the variances.



```{example, binom-hyper}

Suppose there are [21,812 students at Cal Poly, 18,388 of whom are CA residents](https://calpolynews.calpoly.edu/quickfacts.html).  Select a random sample of 35 Cal Poly students, and let $X$ be the number of CA residents in the sample.

```

1. Identify the distribution of $X$, its variance, and $\IP(X\le 27)$ if the sampling is performed *with* replacement.
1. Identify the distribution of $X$, its variance, and $\IP(X\le 27)$ if the sampling is performed *without* replacement.


**Solution.** See the code and output below. The values are virtually identical regardless of whether the sampling is performed with or without replacement.

```{python}

RV(Binomial(35, 18388 / 21812)).sim(100000).plot()
Hypergeometric(n = 35, N1 = 18388, N0 = 21812 - 18388).plot()
plt.xlim(20, 36);
plt.show()
```


```{python}

Binomial(35, 18388 / 21812).cdf(27), Hypergeometric(n = 35, N1 = 18388, N0 = 21812 - 18388).cdf(27)

```

```{python}

Binomial(35, 18388 / 21812).var(), Hypergeometric(n = 35, N1 = 18388, N0 = 21812 - 18388).var()

```


Consider a finite "success/failure" population of size $N$ in which the population proportion of success is $p$.  Suppose a random sample of size $n$ is selected *without* replacement and $X$ is the number of successes in the sample. If the population size $N$ is much larger than the sample size $n$, then

- the selections are "nearly" independent
- $p_X(x)\approx \binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$
- $\Var(X)\approx np(1-p)$

That is, if the population size $N$ is much larger than the sample size $n$, a Hypergeometric distribution is closely approximated by a corresponding Binomial distribution. (We will see soon that a Binomial distribution is often closely approximated by either a Poisson distribution or a Normal distribution).

```{example, binomial-sum}
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be independent random variables and suppose that $X_1$ has a Binomial($n_1$, $p$) distribution and $X_2$ has a  Binomial($n_2$, $p$)   (Note that $p$ is the same.) 
Use a "story proof" to find the distribution of $X_1+X_2$ without any calculations
```


```{solution binomial-sum-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:binomial-sum)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

Suppose $X_1$ counts the number of successes in $n_1$ Bernoulli($p$) trials, and $X_2$ counts the number of successes in $n_2$ Bernoulli($p$) trials.  The two sets of trials are independent since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are.  Then $X_1+X_2$ counts the total number of successes in $n_1+n_2$ Bernoulli($p$) trials.  Therefore $X_1+X_2$ has a Binomial($n_1+n_2$, $p$) distribution.

```

A Binomial(1, $p$) distribution is also known as a **Bernoulli($p$)** distribution, taking a value of 1 with probability $p$ and 0 with probability $1-p$. Any *indicator random variable* has a Bernoulli distribution.

If $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are independent each with a Bernoulli($p$) distribution, then $X_1+\cdots+X_n$ has a Binomial($n, p$) distribution.
So any random variable with a Binomial($n$, $p$) distribution has the same distributional properties as $X_1+  X_2+  \cdots+  X_n$, where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are independent each with a Bernoulli($p$) distribution.  This provides a very convenient representation in many problems.







```{example, binomial-capture-phat}

1. Compute $\SD(\hat{p})$.
1. Suppose that 20 butterflies were selected for the second sample at random, with replacement.
Compute $\SD(\hat{p})$; how does the value compare to the previous part?

```

```{solution binomial-capture-phat-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:binomial-capture-phat)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}


1. $\hat{p}$ is the *proportion* of butterflies in the second sample that are tagged.
Possible values are 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1.
1. Technically $\hat{p}$ does not have a Binomial distribution, since a Binomial distribution always corresponds to possible values 0, 1, 2, $\ldots, n$.
But the distribution of $\hat{p}$ does follow the same shape as the Binomial(5, 0.25) distribution, just with a rescaled variable axis.
1. $\IP(\hat{p} = 0.2) = \IP(X = 1)=\binom{5}{1}0.25^1(1-0.75)^4$.
1. If 25% of the butterflies in the population are tagged, we would expect 25% of the butterflies in a random sample to be tagged.
\[
\E(\hat{p}) = \E(X/5) = \E(X)/5 = 5(0.25)/5 = 0.25
\]
1. $\SD(X/5) = \SD(X)/5$, so
\[
\SD(\hat{p}) = \SD\left(\frac{X}{5}\right) = \frac{\SD(X)}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5(0.25)(1-0.25)}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{0.25(1-0.25)}}{\sqrt{5}} = 0.31
\]
1. The calculation is similar to the previous part.
\[
\SD(\hat{p}) = \SD\left(\frac{X}{20}\right) = \frac{\SD(X)}{20} = \frac{\sqrt{20(0.25)(1-0.25)}}{20} = \frac{\sqrt{0.25(1-0.25)}}{\sqrt{20}} = 0.165
\]
The standard deviation of $\hat{p}$ is smaller when $n$ is larger.
A sample of size 20 is 4 times larger than a sample of size 5, but the standard deviation is $\sqrt{4}=2$ times smaller when $n=20$ than when $n=5$.

```


Binomial distributions model the absolute number of successes in a sample of size $n$.
If $X$ is the number of successes then the *sample proportion* is the random variable
\[
\hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}
\]
For a fixed value of $p$, sample-to-sample variability of $\hat{p}$ *decreases* as sample size $n$ increases.
\begin{align*}
\E\left(\hat{p}\right) & = p\\
\Var\left(\hat{p}\right) & = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\
\SD\left(\hat{p}\right) & = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\
\end{align*}

In a Binomial situation, the number of trials is fixed and we count the (random) number of successes.
In other situations we perform trials until a certain number of successes occurs and we count the (random) number of trials

### Geometric distributions

```{example, geometric-bball}
Maya is a basketball player who makes 40% of her three point field goal attempts.  Suppose that she attempts three pointers until she makes one and then stops.  Let $X$ be the total number of shots she attempts.  Assume shot attempts are independent.

```

1. What are the possible values that $X$ can take?  Is $X$ discrete or continuous?
1. Compute $\IP(X=3)$.
1. Find the probability mass function of $X$.
1. Construct a table, plot, and spinner representing the distribution of $X$.
1. Compute $\IP(X>5)$ without summing.
1. Find the cdf of $X$ without summing.
1. What seems like a reasonable general formula for $\E(X)$?  Make a guess, and then compute and interpret $\E(X)$ for this example.
1. Would $\Var(X)$ be bigger or smaller if $p=0.9$?  If $p=0.1$?


```{solution geometric-bball-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:geometric-bball)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. $X$ does not have a Binomial distribution since the number of trials is not fixed.
1. $X$ can take values 1, 2, 3, $\ldots$.  Even though it is unlikely that $X$ is very large, there is no fixed upper bound.  Even though $X$ can take infinitely many values, $X$ is a discrete random variables because it takes *countably* many possible values.
1. In order for $X$ to be 3, Maya must miss her first two attempts and make her third. Since the attempts are independent $\IP(X=3)=(1-0.4)^2(0.4)=0.144$.  If Maya does this every practice, then in about 14.4% of practices she will make her first three pointer on her third attempt.
1. In order for $X$ to take value $x$, the first success must occur on attempt $x$, so the first $x-1$ attempts must be failures.
    \[
    p_X(x) = (1-0.4)^{x-1}(0.4), \qquad x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots  
    \]
    This the called the *Geometric distribution with parameter 0.4.*
1. See below.
1. The key is to realize that Maya requires more than 5 attempts to obtain her first success if and only if the first 5 attempts are failures.  Therefore,      \[
     P(X > 5) = (1-0.4)^5  = 0.078
     \]
1. The cdf is $F_X(x)=\IP(X \le x) = 1-\IP(X > x)$. Use the complement rule and a calculation like in the previous part.  The key is to realize that Maya requires more than $x$ attempts to obtain her first success if and only if the first $x$ attempts are failures.  Therefore, $P(X > x) = (1-0.4)^x$ and 
    \[
    F_X(x) = 1-(1-0.4)^x, \qquad x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots 
    \]
    However, remember that a cdf is defined for all real values, not just the possible values of $X$.  The cdf of a discrete random variable is a step function with jumps at the possible values of $X$.  For example, $X\le 3.5$ only if $X\in\{1, 2, 3\}$ so $F_X(3.5) = \IP(X \le 3.5) = \IP(X \le 3) = F_X(3)$.  Therefore,
    \[
    F_X(x) =
    \begin{cases}
    1-(1-0.4)^{\text{floor}(x)}, & x \ge 1,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise,}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    where floor($x$) is the greatest integer that is at most $x$, e.g., floor(3.5) = 3, floor(3) = 3.
1. Suppose for a second that she only makes 10% of her attempts.  That is, she makes 1 in every 10 attempts on average, so it seems reasonable that we would expect her to attempt 10 three pointers on average before she makes one.  Therefore, $1/0.4= 2.5$ seems like a reasonable formula for $\E(X)$.  If she does this at every practice, then it takes her on average 2.5 three point attempts before she makes one.

    We can use the law of total expected value to compute $\mu=\E(X)$.  Condition on the result of the first attempt.  She makes the first attempt with probability 0.4 in which case she makes no further attempts.  Otherwise, she misses the first attempt and is back where she started; the expected number of *additional* attempts is $\mu$.  Therefore, $\mu = 0.4(1+0) + 0.6(1+\mu)$, and solving gives $\mu=2.5$.
1. If the probability of success is $p=0.9$ we would not expect to wait very long until the first success, so it would be unlikely for her to need more than a few attempts.  If the probability of success is $p=0.1$ then she could make her first attempt and be done quickly, or it could take her a long time.  So the variance is greater when $p=0.1$ and less when $p=0.9$.

```


The distribution of $X$ in the previous problem is called the Geometric(0.4) distribution.
The parameter 0.4 is the marginal probability of success on any single trial.

    - the $x$th (last) trial results in success.
Therefore $\IP(X = x) = p(1-p)^{x-1}, x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.

Greater than $x$ trials are needed to achieve the first success if and only if the first $x$ trials result in failure.
Therefore, $\IP(X > x) = (1-p)^x, x = 1, 2, 3,\ldots$

The fact that $\E(X)=1/p$ can be proven by conditioning on the result of the first trial and using the law of total expectation, similar to what we did in the first part of Example \@ref(exm:lookaway-ce).

The variance of a Geometric distribution increases as $p$ gets closer to 0.
If $p$ is close to 1, we expect to see success in the first few trials, but if $p$ is close to 0, we could have to wait a larger number of trials until the first success occurs.


```{example lookaway-geometric}
Recall Example \@ref(exm:lookaway).
You and your friend are playing the ["lookaway challenge"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-are-your-chances-of-winning-the-u-s-open/).
The game consists of possibly multiple rounds. In the first round, you point in one of four directions: up, down, left or right. At the exact same time, your friend also looks in one of those four directions. If your friend looks in the same direction you're pointing, you win! Otherwise, you switch roles and the game continues to the next round — now your friend points in a direction and you try to look away. (So the player who starts as the pointer is the pointer in the odd-numbered rounds, and the player who starts as the looker is the pointer in the even-numbered rounds, until the game ends.) As long as no one wins, you keep switching off who points and who looks.
The game ends, and the current "pointer" wins, whenever the  "looker" looks in the same direction as the pointer.
Let $X$ be the number of rounds played in a game.
```


1. Explain why $X$ has a Geometric distribution, and specify the value of $p$.
1. Use the Geometric pmf (use software) to compute the probability that the player who starts as the pointer wins the game.

```{solution lookaway-geometric-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:lookaway-geometric)
```


1. $X$ has a Geometric distribution with parameter $p=0.25$.
    - Each round is a trial,
    - the round either results in success (current pointer wins the round and game ends) or failure (current pointer does not win the round and the game continues),
    - the rounds are assumed to be independent
    - the probability that the current point wins any particular round is 0.25
    - and $X$ counts the number of rounds until the first success
1. The player who starts as the pointer wins the game if $X$ is odd.
So we need to sum the Geometric(0.25) pmf over $x=1,3,5,\ldots$.
See below.


Geometric pmfs are built in to Symbulate.
We can find the probability that $X$ is odd by summing the pmf over $x = 1, 3, 5, \ldots$

```{python}
Geometric(0.25).pmf(range(1, 100, 2)).sum() # range(1, 100, 2) is odd numbers up to 100
```


Below we simulate values of $X$ in the lookaway challenge problem.
The simulated distribution is consistent with the Geometric(0.4) distribution.


```{python}

def count_rounds(sequence):
    for r, pair in enumerate(sequence):
        if pair[0] == pair[1]:
            return r + 1 # +1 for 0 indexing

P = BoxModel([1, 2, 3, 4], size = 2) ** inf

X = RV(P, count_rounds)

x = X.sim(25000)

Approximate probability that the player who starts as the pointer wins the game (which occurs if the game ends in an odd number of rounds).

### Negative Binomial Distributions



```{example, nb-bball}
Maya is a basketball player who makes 86% of her free throw attempts.  Suppose that she attempts free throws until she makes 5 and then stops.  Let $X$ be the total number of free throws she attempts.  Assume shot attempts are independent.

``` 

1. Does $X$ have a Binomial distribution?  Why or why not?
1. What are the possible values of $X$? Is $X$ discrete or continuous?
1. Compute $\IP(X=5)$
1. Compute $\IP(X=6)$
1. Compute $\IP(X=7)$
1. Compute $\IP(Y=8)$
1. Find the probability mass function of $X$.
1. What seems like a reasonable general formula for $\E(X)$?  Interpret $\E(X)$ for this example.
1. Would the variance be larger or smaller if attempted free throws until she made 10 instead of 5?


```{solution nb-bball-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:nb-bball)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. $X$ does not have a Binomial distribution since the number of *trials* is not fixed.  The number of *successes* is fixed to be 5, but the number of trials is random.
1. $X$ can take values 5, 6, 7, $\ldots$.  Even though it is unlikely that $X$ is very large, there is no fixed upper bound.  Even though $X$ can take infinitely values, $X$ is a discrete random variables because it takes *countably* many possible values.
1. In order for $X$ to be 5, Maya must make her first 5 attempts. Since the attempts are independent $\IP(X=5)=(0.86)^5=0.47$.  If Maya does this every practice, then in about 47% of practices she will make her first five free throw attempts.
1. In order for $X$ to be 6, Maya must miss exactly one of her first 5 attempts and then make her 6th. (If she didn't miss any of her first 5 attempts then she would be done in 5 attempts.) Consider the case where she misses her first attempt and then makes the next 5; this has probability $(1-0.86)(0.86)^5$.  Any particular sequence with exactly 1 miss among the first 5 attempts and a make on the 6th attempt has this same probability.  There are 5 "spots" for where the 1 miss can go, so there are $\binom{5}{1} = 5$ possible sequences.  Therefore
    \[
    \IP(X=6) = \binom{5}{1}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^1 = 0.329
    \]
    Equivalently, the 4 successes, excluding the final success, must occur in the first 5 attempts, so there are $\binom{5}{4}$ possible sequences.  Note that $\binom{5}{1} = 5 = \binom{5}{4}$.  So we can also write
    \[
    \IP(X=6) = \binom{5}{4}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^1 = 0.329
    \]
1. In order for $X$ to be 7, Maya must miss exactly two of her first 6 attempts and then make her 7th. Any particular sequence of this form has probability $(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^2$ and there are $\binom{6}{2}=\binom{6}{4}$ possible sequences.  Therefore
    \begin{align*}
    \IP(X=7) & = \binom{6}{2}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^2 = 0.138\\
    & = \binom{6}{4}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^2
    \end{align*}
1. In order for $X$ to be 8, Maya must miss exactly three of her first 7 attempts and then make her 8th. Any particular sequence of this form has probability $(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^3$ and there are $\binom{7}{3}=\binom{7}{4}$ possible sequences.  Therefore
    \begin{align*}
    \IP(X=8) & = \binom{7}{3}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^3 = 0.045\\
    & = \binom{7}{4}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^3
    \end{align*}
1. In order for $X$ to take value $x$, the last trial must be success and the first $x-1$ trials must consist of $5-1=4$ successes and $x-5$ failures. There are $\binom{x-1}{5-1}$ ways to have $4$ successes among the first $x-1$ trials.  (This is the same as saying there are $\binom{x-1}{x-5}$ ways to have $x-5$ failures among the first $x-1$ trials.)
    \begin{align*}
    p_X(x) = \IP(X=x) & = \binom{x-1}{5-1}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^{x-5}, \qquad x = 5, 6, 7, \ldots\\
    & = \binom{x-1}{x-5}(0.86)^5(1-0.86)^{x-5}, \qquad x = 5, 6, 7, \ldots
    \end{align*}
1. On average it takes $1/0.86 = 1.163$ attempts to make a free throw, so it seems reasonable that it would take on average $5(1/0.86)=5.81$ attempts to make 5 free throws.  If Maya does this at every practice, it takes her on average 5.8 attempts to make 5 free throws.
1. The variance would be larger with 10 attempts.

A discrete random variable $X$ has a **Negative Binomial distribution** with parameters $r$, a positive integer, and  $p\in[0, 1]$ if its probability mass function is
\begin{align*}
p_{X}(x) & = \binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}, & x=r, r+1, r+2, \ldots
\end{align*}
If $X$ has a NegativeBinomial($r$, $p$) distribution
\begin{align*}
\E(X) & = \frac{r}{p}\\
\Var(X) & = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}
\end{align*}

```


Suppose you perform a sequence of Bernoulli($p$) trials until $r$ successes occur and then stop.  Let $X$ be the total number of *trials* performed, including the trials on which the successes occur.  Then $X$ has a NegativeBinomial($r$,$p$) distribution. In this situation, exactly $x$ trials are performed if and only if

- there are exactly $r-1$ successes among the first $x-1$ trials, and 
- the $x$th (last) trial results in success.

There are $\binom{x-1}{r-1}$ possible sequences that satisfy the above, and each of these sequences --- with $r$ successes and $x-r$ failures --- has probability $p^r(1-p)^{x-r}$.


```{example, nb-geom}
What is another name for a NegativeBinomial(1,$p$) distribution?

```


```{solution nb-geom-sol}

```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}
A NegativeBinomial(1,$p$) distribution is a Geometric($p$) distribution.

```


```{example, nb-geom-sum}
Suppose $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ are independent each with a Geometric($p$) distribution.  What is the distribution of $X_1+\cdots + X_r$?  Find the expected value and variance of this distribution.

```


```{solution nb-geom-sum-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:nb-geom-sum)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}
Consider a long sequence of Bernoulli($p$) trials.  Let $X_1$ count the number of trials until the 1st success occurs.  Starting immediately after the first success occurs, let $X_2$ count the number of *additional* trials until the 2nd success occurs, so that $X_1+X_2$ is the total number of trials until the first 2 successes occur.  Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, then the two sets of trials are independent.  That is, $X_1+X_2$ counts the number of trials until 2 successes occur in Bernoulli($p$) trials, so $X_1+X_2$ has a Negative Binomial(2, $p$) distribution.  Continuining in this way we see that if $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ are independent each with a Geometric($p$) distribution then $(X_1+\cdots+X_r)$ has a NegativeBinomial($r$,$p$) distribution.

If $X$ has a NegativeBinomial($r$,$p$) distribution then it has the same distributional properties as  $(X_1+\cdots+X_r)$  where $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ are independent each with a Geometric($p$) distribution.  Therefore we can compute the mean of a Negative Binomial distribution by computing
\[
\E(X_1+\cdots+X_r)  =\E(X_1)+\cdots+\E(X_r) = \frac{1}{p} + \cdots + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{r}{p}
\]
We can use a similar technique to compute the variance of a Negative Binomial distribution, because the $X_i$s are independent.
\[
\Var(X_1+\cdots+X_r)  \stackrel{\text{(independent)}}{=}\Var(X_1)+\cdots+\Var(X_r) = \frac{1-p}{p^2} + \cdots + \frac{1-p}{p^2} = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}
\]

### Pascal distributions

In a Negative Binomial situation, the total number of successes is fixed ($r$), i.e., not random.  What is random is the number of failures, and hence the total number of trials.




Our definition of a Negative Binomial distribution (and hence a Geometric distribution) provides a model for a random variable which counts the number of Bernoulli($p$) *trials* required until $r$ successes occur, *including* the $r$ trials on which success occurs, so the possible values are $r, r+1, r+2,\ldots$

There is an alternative definition of a Negative Binomial distribution (and hence a Geometric distribution)   which provides a model for a random variable which counts the number of *failures* in Bernoulli($p$) trials required until $r$ successes occur, *excluding* the $r$ trials on which success occurs, so the possible values are $0, 1, 2, \ldots$
Many software programs, including R, use this alternative definition. In Symbulate, a Pascal($r$, $p$) distribution follows this alternate definition. In Symbulate,

- The possible values of a NegativeBinomial($r$, $p$) distribution are $r, r+1, r+2,\ldots$
- The possible values of a Pascal($r$, $p$) distribution are $0, 1, 2,\ldots$

If $X$ has a NegativeBinomial($r$, $p$) distribution then $(X-r)$ has a Pascal($r$, $p$) distribution.





## Poisson distributions {#poisson}


```{example, poisson-hr-intro}
Let $X$ be the number of home runs hit (in total by both teams) in a randomly selected Major League Baseball game.
```

1. In what ways is this like the Binomial situation?  (What is a trial?  What is "success"?)
1. In what ways is this NOT like the Binomial situation?

```{solution poisson-hr-intro-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:poisson-hr-intro)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. Each pitch is a trial, and on each trial either a home run is hit ("success") or not.  The random variable $X$ counts the number of home runs (successes) over all the trials
1. Even though $X$ is counting successes, this is not the Binomial situation.
    - The number of trials is not fixed.  The total number of pitches varies from game to game. (The average is around 300 pitches per game).
    - The probability of success is not the same on each trial.  Different batters have different probabilities of hitting home runs.  Also, different pitch counts or game situations lead to different probabilities of home runs.
    - The trials might not be independent, though this is a little more questionable.  Make sure you distinguish independence from the previous assumption of unequal probabilities of success; you need to consider conditional probabilities to assess independence.  Maybe if a pitcher gives up a home run on one pitch, then the pitcher is "rattled" so the probability that he also gives up a home run on the next pitch increases, or the pitcher gets pulled for a new pitcher which changes the probability of a home run on the next pitch.


```


```{example, poisson-accidents-intro}
Let $X$ be the number of automobiles that get in accidents on Highway 101 in San Luis Obispo on a randomly selected day.
```

1. In what ways is this like the Binomial situation?  (What is a trial?  What is "success"?)
1. In what ways is this NOT like the Binomial situation?
1. Which of the following do you think it would be easier to estimate by collecting and analyzing relevant data?

    - The total number of cars on the highway each day, and the probability that each driver on the highway has an accident.
    - The average number of accidents per day that happen on the highway.

```{solution poisson-accidents-intro-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:poisson-accidents-intro)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. Each automobile on the road in the day is a trial, and each automobile either gets in an accident ("success") or not.  The random variable $X$ counts the number of automobiles that get into accidents  (successes).  (Remember "success" is just a generic label for the event you're interested in; "success" is not necessarily good.)
1. Even though $X$ is counting successes, this is not the Binomial situation.
    - The number of trials is not fixed.  The  total number of automobiles on the road varies from day to day.
    - The probability of success is not the same on each trial.  Different drivers have different probabilities of getting into accidents; some drivers are safer than others.  Also, different conditions increase the probability of an accident, like driving at night.
    - The trials are plausibly not independent.  Make sure you distinguish independence from the previous assumption of unequal probabilities of success; you need to consider conditional probabilities to assess independence.  If an automobile gets into an accident, then the probability of getting into an accident increases for the automobiles that are driving near it.
1. It would be very difficult to estimate the probability that each individual driver gets into an accident.  (Though you probably could measure the total number of cars.)  It would be much easier to find data on total number of accidents that happen each day over some period of time, e.g., from police reports, and use it to estimate the average number of accidents per day.

```

The Binomial model has several restrictive assumptions that might not be satisfied in practice

- The number of trials must be fixed (not random) and known.
- The probability of success must be the same for each trial (fixed, not random) and known.
- The trials must be independent.

Even when the trials  are independent with the same probability of success, fitting a Binomial model to data requires estimation of both $n$ and $p$ individually, rather than just the mean $\mu=np$.  When the only data available are success counts (e.g., number of accidents per day for a sample of days) $\mu$ can be estimated but $n$ and $p$ individually cannot.

Poisson models are more flexible models for counts.  Poisson models are parameterized by a single parameter (the mean) and do not require all the assumptions of a Binomial model.  Poisson distributions are often used to model the distribution of random variables that count the number of "relatively rare" events that occur over a certain interval of time in a certain region (e.g., number of accidents on a highway in a day, number of car insurance policies that have claims in a week, number of bank loans that go into default, number of mutations in a DNA sequence, number of earthquakes that occurs in SoCal in an hour, etc.)

```{definition, def-poisson2}
A discrete random variable $X$ has a **Poisson distribution** with parameter^[The parameter for a Poisson distribution is often denoted $\lambda$.  However, we use $\mu$ to denote the parameter of a Poisson distribution, and reserve $\lambda$  to denote the rate parameter of a *Poisson process* (which has mean $\lambda t$ at time $t$).] $\mu>0$ if its probability mass function $p_X$ satisfies
\begin{align*}
p_X(x) & \propto \frac{\mu^x}{x!}, \;\qquad x=0,1,2,\ldots\\
& = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!}, \quad x=0,1,2,\ldots
\end{align*}
If $X$ has a Poisson($\mu$) distribution then
\begin{align*}
\E(X) & = \mu\\
\Var(X) & = \mu
\end{align*}

```


The shape of a Poisson pmf as a function of $x$ is given by $\mu^x/x!$. The constant $e^{-\mu}$ simply renormalizes the heights of the pmf so  that the probabilities sum to 1.  Recall the Taylor series expansion: $e^{\mu} = \sum_{x=0}^\infty \frac{\mu^x}{x!}$.

For a Poisson distribution, both the mean and variance are equal to $\mu$, but remember that the mean is measured in the count units (e.g., home runs) but the variance is measured in squared units (e.g., $(\text{home runs})^2$).

    \[

    \[

    About 22.2% of pages have exactly 1 typo.
    
1. Find the probability that a randomly selected page has exactly two typographical errors.

    About 3.3% of pages have exactly 2 typos.
    
1. Find the probability that a randomly selected page has at least three typographical errors.
    \[

    About 0.36% of pages have at least 3 typos.
    
1. Provide a long run interpretation of the parameter $\mu=0.3$.

    There are 0.3 typos per page on average.
    
1. Suppose that each page in the book contains exactly 2000 characters and that the probability that any single character is a typo is 0.00015, independently of all other characters.  Let $X$ be the number of characters on a randomly selected page that are typos.  Identify the distribution of $X$ and its expected value and variance, and compare to a Poisson(0.3) distribution.

    In this case $X$ has a Binomial(2000, 0.00015) distribution with mean $2000(0.00015) = 0.3$ and variance $2000(0.00015)(1-0.00015) = 0.299955 \approx 0.3 = 2000(0.00015)$.  See below for a simulation; the Binomial(2000, 0.00015) is very similar to the Poisson(0.3) distribution.

**Poisson aggregation.** If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, $X$ has a Poisson($\mu_X$) distribution,  and $Y$ has a Poisson($\mu_Y$) distribution, then $X+Y$ has a Poisson($\mu_X+\mu_Y$) distribution.

If $X$ has mean $\mu_X$ and $Y$ has mean $\mu_Y$ then linearity of expected value implies that $X+Y$ has mean $\mu_X + \mu_Y$.  If $X$ has variance $\mu_X$ and $Y$ has variance $\mu_Y$ then independence of $X$ and $Y$ implies that $X+Y$ has variance $\mu_X + \mu_Y$.  What Poisson aggregation says is that if component counts are independent and each has a Poisson distribution, then the total count also has a Poisson distribution.

Here's one proof involving law of total probability^[There are easier proofs, e.g., using moment generating functions.]: We want to show that $p_{X+Y}(z) =  \frac{e^{-(\mu_X+\mu_Y)}(\mu_X+\mu_Y)^z}{z!}$ for $z=0,1,2,\ldots$

    - Spin the Poisson(1) spinner once to generate $X$.
    - Spin the Poisson(2) spinner once to generate $Y$.
    - Compute $X + Y$.  If $X + Y = 2$ keep and record $X$; otherwise discard the repetition.

1. Compute $\IP(X=0|X+Y=2)$. The key is to take advantage of the fact that while $X$ and $X+Y$ are not independent, $X$ and $Y$ are.  Write events involving $X$ and $X+Y$ in terms of equivalent events involving $X$ and $Y$.  For example, the event $\{X = 0, X+ Y = 2\}$ is the same as the event $\{X = 0, Y = 2\}$.  Also, remember that by Poisson aggregation $(X+Y)$ has a Poisson(3) distribution.

### Poisson approximation {#poisson-approx}

Where do Poisson distributions come from? We saw in Example \@ref(exm:poisson-typos) that the Binomial(2000, 0.00015) distribution is approximately the Poisson(0.3) distribution.  This is an example of the "Poisson approximation to the Binomial".  If $X$ counts the number of successes in a Binomial situation where the number of trials $n$ is large and the probability of success on any trial $p$ is small, then $X$ has an approximate Poisson distribution with parameter $np$.

Let's see why. We'll reparametrize the Binomial($2000, 0.00015$) pmf in terms of the mean $0.3$, and apply some algebra and some approximations.  Remember, the pmf is a distribution on values of the count $x$, for $x=0, 1, 2, \ldots$, but the probabilities are negligible if $x$ is not small.


\begin{align*}
& \quad \binom{2000}{x}0.00015^x(1-0.00015)^{2000-x}\\
= & \quad \frac{2000!}{x!(2000-x)!}\frac{0.3^x}{2000^x}\left(1-\frac{0.3}{2000}\right)^{2000}(1-0.00015)^{-x} & & \text{algebra, $0.00015=0.3/2000$}\\
= & \quad \frac{2000(2000-1)(2000-2)\cdots(2000-x+1)}{(2000)(2000)(2000)\cdots(2000)}\frac{0.3^x}{x!}\left(1-\frac{0.3}{2000}\right)^{2000}(1-0.00015)^{-x} & & \text{algebra, rearranging}\\
= & \quad \left(1-\frac{1}{2000}\right)\left(1-\frac{2}{2000}\right)\cdots\left(1-\frac{x-1}{2000}\right)\frac{0.3^x}{x!}(0.7408)(1-0.00015)^{-x} & & \text{algebra, rearranging}\\
\approx & \quad (1)\frac{0.3^x}{x!}(0.7408)(1) & & \text{approximating, for $x$ small}\\
\approx & \quad e^{-0.3} \frac{0.3^x}{x!}
\end{align*}


The above calculation shows that the Binomial(2000, 0.3) pmf is approximately equal to the Poisson(0.3) pmf.

Now we'll consider a general Binomial situation. Let $X$ count the number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli($p$) trials, so $X$ has a  Binomial($n$,$p$) distribution.
Suppose that $n$ is "large", $p$ is "small" (so success is "rare") and $np$ is "moderate".
Then $X$ has an approximate Poisson distribution with mean $np$.
The following states this idea more formally. The limits in the following make precise the notions of "large" ($n\to \infty$), "small" ($p_n\to 0$), and  "moderate" ($np_n\to \mu \in (0,\infty)$).


**Poisson approximation to Binomial.** Consider $n$ Bernoulli trials with probability of success on each trial^[When there are $n$ trials, the probability of success on each of the $n$ trials is $p_n$.  The subscript $n$ indicates that this value can change as $n$ changes (e.g. 1/10 when $n=10$, 1/100 when $n=100$), so that when $n$ is large $p$ is small enough to maintain relative "rarity".] equal to $p_n$.   Suppose that $n\to\infty$ while $p_n\to0$ and $np_n\to\mu$, where $0<\mu<\infty$.  Then
for $x=0,1,2,\ldots$
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \binom{n}{x} p_n^x \left(1-p_n\right)^{n-x} = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!}
\]


The proof relies on the same ideas we used in the Binomial(2000, 0.00015) approximation above. Fix $x=0,1,2,\ldots$  (Since we are letting $n\to\infty$ we can assume that $n>x$.)  Some algebra and rearranging yields
	\begin{align*}
	\binom{n}{x} p_n^x \left(1-p_n\right)^{n-x} &= \left(\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}\right)\left(\frac{np_n}{n}\right)^x\left(1-p_n\right)^n\left(1-p_n\right)^{-x}\\
	& = \left(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-x+1)}{n^x}\right)\left(\frac{\left(np_n\right)^x}{x!}\right)\left(1-\frac{np_n}{n}\right)^n\left(1-p_n\right)^{-x}\\
	& \to (1)\left(\frac{\mu^x}{x!}\right)e^{-\mu}(1)
	\end{align*}

Poisson approximation of Binomial is one way that Poisson distributions arise, but it is far from the only way.  Part of the usefulness of Poisson models is that they do not require the strict assumptions of the Binomial situation.

```{example, matching-poisson}

Recall the matching problem in Example \@ref(exm:matching-ev) with a general $n$: there are $n$ rocks that are shuffled and placed uniformly at random in $n$ spots with one rock per spot.  Let $Y$ be the number of matches.  We have seen:

- The exact distribution of $Y$ when $n=4$, via enumerating outcomes in the sample space (Example \@ref(exm:matching-ev)).
- The approximate distribution for any $n$, via simulation (Section \@ref(sim-matching-n))
- $\E(Y)=1$ for any value of $n$, via linearity of expected value (Example \@ref(exm:matching-ev-n)).

Now we'll consider the distribution of $Y$ for general $n$.
  
```

1. Use simulation to approximate the distribution of $Y$ for different values of $n$.  How does the approximate distribution of $Y$ change with $n$?
1. Does $Y$ have a Binomial distribution?  Consider: What is a trial?  What is success?  Is the number of trials fixed?  Is the probability of success the same on each trial? Are the trials independent?
1. If $Y$ has an approximate Poisson distribution, what would the parameter have to be?  Compare this Poisson distribution with the simulation results; does it seem like a reasonable approximation?
1. For a general $n$, approximate $\IP(Y=y)$ for $y=0, 1, 2, \ldots$. 
1. For a general value of $n$, approximate the probability that there is at least one match.  How does this depend on $n$?



```{solution matching-poisson-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:matching-poisson)
```


```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. Simulation results for $n=10$ are displayed below. Clicking on the link to the Colab notebook will take you to an interactive plot where you can change the value of $n$.  We see that unless $n$ is really small (5 or less) then the distribution of $Y$ essentially does not depend on $n$.  That's amazing!
1. Each rock is a trial, and success occurs if it is put in the correct spot.  There are $n$ trials, fixed.  The *unconditional* probability of success the same on each trial, $1/n$. However, the trials are not strictly independent.  For example, if the heaviest rock is placed in the correct spot, the conditional probability that the next heaviest rock is placed in the correct spot is $1/(n-1)$; if all rocks except for the lightest rock are placed in the correct spots, then the conditional probability that the lightest rock is placed in the correct spot is 1. So $Y$ does not have a Binomial distribution.
1. We have already seen $\E(Y)=1$ (exactly) for all $n$, so if $Y$ has an approximate Poisson distribution the parameter has to be 1.  Yes, it does seem from the simulation results that the Poisson(1) approximates the distribution of $Y$ pretty well, for *any* $n$ (unless $n$ is really small).
1. Just use the Poisson(1) pmf; see the spinner in Figure \@ref(fig:poisson-spinners1). 
\[
\IP(Y = y) \approx \frac{e^{-1}1^y}{y!}, \qquad y = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
\]
    Since $1^y=1$, $\IP(Y=y)$ is approximately proportional to $\frac{1}{y!}$: 1 is as likely as 0, 2 is 1/2 as likely as 1, 3 is 1/3 as likely as 2, 4 is 1/4 as likely as 3, and so on.
1. Since $\IP(Y = 0)\approx e^{-1}/0! = e^{-1}\approx0.368$, the approxiate probability that there is at least one match is $1-e^{-1}\approx 0.632$, for *any* $n$ (unless $n$ is really small).  Amazing!

```

```{python}

n = 10
labels = list(range(n)) # list of labels [0, ..., n-1]

# define a function which counts number of matches
def count_matches(x):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, n, 1):
        if x[i] == labels[i]:
            count += 1
    return count

P = BoxModel(labels, size = n, replace = False)

Y = RV(P, count_matches)

y = Y.sim(10000)

Poisson models often provide good approximations to Binomial models.
More importantly, Poisson models often provide good approximations for "count data" when the restrictive assumptions of Binomial models are not satisfied.

Some advantages for using a Poisson model rather than a Binomial model

- In a Poisson model, the number of trials doesn't need to be specified; it can be unknown or random (e.g. the number of automobiles on a highway varies from day to day).  The number of trials just has to be "large" (though what constitutes large depends on the situation; $n$ didn't have to be very large in the matching problem for the Poisson approximation to kick in.)
    - In a Binomial model, the number of trials must be fixed and known.
- In a Poisson model, the probability of success does not need to be the same for all trials, and the probability of success for individual trials does not need to be known or estimated.  The only requirement is that the probability of success is "comparably small" for all trials.
    - In a Binomial model, the probability of success must be the same for all trials and must be fixed and known.
- Fitting a Poisson model to data only requires data on total counts, so that the average number of successes can be estimated.
    - Fitting a Binomial model to data requires results from individual trials so that the probability of success can be estimated.  (For example, you would need to know both the total number of automobiles on the road and the number that got into accidents.)
- In a Poisson model, the trials are not required to be strictly independent as long as the trials are "not too dependent".
    - In a Binomial model, the trials must be independent.



```{example, birthday-poisson}

Recall the birthday problem from Example \@ref(exm:birthday): in a group of $n$ people what is the probability that at least two have the same birthday?  (Ignore multiple births and February 29 and assume that the other 365 days are all equally likely.)  We will investigate this problem using Poisson approximation. Imagine that we have a trial for each possible *pair* of people in the group, and let "success" indicate that the pair shares a birthday.  Consider both a general $n$ and $n=35$.

```

1. How many trials are there?
1. Do the trials have the same probability of success?  If so, what is it?
1. Are any *two* trials independent?  To answer this questions, suppose that three people in the group are Ki-taek, Chung-sook, and Ki-jung and consider any *two* of the trials that involve these three people.
1. Are any *three* trials independent?  Consider the three trials that involve Ki-taek, Chung-sook, and Ki-jung.
1. Let $X$ be the number of *pairs* that share a birthday. Does $X$ have a Binomial distribution?
1. In what way are the trials "not too dependent"?
1. Use simulation to approximate the distribution of $X$.  How does the distribution change with $n$?
1. If $X$ has an approximate Poisson distribution, what would the parameter have to be?  Compare this Poisson distribution with the simulation results; does it seem like a reasonable approximation?
1. Approximate the probability that at least two people share the same birthday.  Compare to the theoretical values from Example \@ref(exm:birthday).
1. Using the approximation from the previous part, how large does $n$ need to be for the approximate probability to be at least 0.5?


```{solution, birthday-poisson-sol}
to Example \@ref(exm:birthday-poisson)
```

```{asis, fold.chunk = TRUE}

1. Each pair is a trial so there are $\binom{n}{2}$ trials.  If $n=35$ there are $\binom{35}{2}=595$ pairs; if $n=23$ there are $\binom{23}{2}=253$ pairs.
1. The probability of success on any trial is 1/365.  For any pair, the probability that the pair shares a birthday is 1/365.  For any two people, there are $365\times 365$ possible pairs of birthdays ((Jan 1, Jan 1), (Jan 1, Jan 2), etc.), of which there are 365 possibilities in which the two share a birthday ((Jan 1, Jan 1), (Jan 2, Jan 2), etc.), so the probability is $\frac{365}{365\times 365}$. 
1. Yes, any *two* trials are independent. Let $A$ be the event that Ki-taek and Chung-sook share a birthday, and let $B$ be the event that Ki-taek and Ki-jung share a birthday.  Then $\IP(A)=1/365$ and $\IP(B)=1/365$.  The event $A\cap B$ is the event that all three share a birthday.  There are $365^3$ possible triples of birthdays for the three people ((Jan 1 for Ki-taek, Jan 1 for Ki-jung, Jan 2 for Chung-sook), etc) of which there are 365 possibilities in which all three share a birthday (e.g., (Jan 1, Jan 1, Jan 1), etc).  Therefore
    \[
    \IP(A\cap B) = \frac{365}{365^3} =    \left(\frac{1}{365}\right)\left(\frac{1}{365}\right) = \IP(A)\IP(B),
    \]
    so $A$ and $B$ are independent.
1. No, not every set of three trials is independent. Let $A$ be the event that Ki-taek and Chung-sook share a birthday, let $B$ be the event that Ki-taek and Ki-jung share a birthday, and let $C$ be the event that Chung-sook and Ki-jung share a birthday.  Then $\IP(A)=\IP(B)=\IP(C)=1/365$.  The event $A \cap B\cap C$ is the event that all three people share the same birthday, which has probability $\frac{1}{365^2}$ as in the previous part.  Therefore,
    \[
      \IP(A\cap B\cap B) = \frac{365}{365^3} \neq \left(\frac{1}{365}\right)\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)\left(\frac{1}{365}\right) = \IP(A)\IP(B)\IP(C)
    \]
    So these three trials are not independent. Alternatively, if $A$ and $B$ are both true, then $C$ must also be true so $\IP(C|A\cap B)=1 \neq 1/365 =\IP(C)$.
    However, there are many sets of three trials that are independent.  In particular, any three trials involving six distinct people are independent.
1. Since the trials are not independent, $X$ does not have a Binomial distribution.
1. Any two trials are independent.  Many sets of three trials are independent. Many sets of four trials are independent (e.g., any set involving 8 distinct people), etc.  So generally, information on multiple events is required to change the conditional probabilities of other events.  In this way, the trials are "not too dependent".
1. See the simulation results for $n=35$ below, and click on the link to a Colab notebook with an interactive simulation.  We see that the distribution does depend on $n$; as $n$ increases the distribution of $X$ places more probability on larger values of $X$.
1. There are $\binom{n}{2}$ trials and the probability of success on each trial is 1/365, so
\[
\E(X) = \binom{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)  
\]
    Remember, the "number of trials $\times$ probability of success" formula works regardless of whether the trials are independent (as long as the probability of success is the same for all trials).  For $n=35$, $\E(X)=\binom{35}{2}\frac{1}{365} = 1.63$; for $n=23$, $\E(X)=\binom{23}{2}\frac{1}{365} = 0.693$.
    Therefore, if $X$ has an approximate Poisson distribution, then it is the Poisson distribution with paramater $\binom{n}{2}/365$.
The Poisson approximation seems to fit the simulation results fairly well.
1. The probability that at least two people share the same birthday is $1-\IP(X=0)$.  Using the Poisson approximation
    \[
    1 - \IP(X=0) \approx 1 - \exp\left(-\binom{n}{2}\frac{1}{365}\right)  
    \]
    For $n=35$ the approximate probability is $1-e^{-1.63}=0.804$; the theoretical probability is 0.814. Figure \@ref(fig:birthday-poisson-plot) plots the theoretical probability and the approximate probability for different values of $n$. The approximation seems to work pretty well.
1. The smallest value of $n$ for which the approximate probability is at least 0.5 is $n=23$, in which case the approximate probability is $1-e^{-1.63}=0.500$.  The theoretical probability for $n=23$ is 0.507.

**Poisson paradigm.** Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ be a collection of $n$ events.  Suppose event $i$ occurs with marginal probability $p_i=\IP(A_i)$. Let $N = \ind_{A_i} + \ind_{A_2} + \cdots + \ind_{A_n}$ be the random variable which counts the number of the events in the collection which occur. Suppose

- $n$ is "large",
- $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ are "comparably small", and
- the events $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are "not too dependent",

Then $N$ has an approximate Poisson distribution with parameter $\E(N) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$.

We are leaving the terms "large", "comparably small", and "not too dependent" undefined.  There are many different versions of Poisson approximations which make these ideas more precise.  We only remark that Poisson approximation holds in a wide variety of situations.

The individual event probabilities $p_i$ can be different, but they must be "comparably small".  If one $p_i$ is much greater than the others, then the count random variable $N$ is dominated by whether event $A_i$ occurs or not. Also, as long as $\E(N)$ is available, it is not necessary to know the individual $p_i$.

Even though $n$ is a constant in the above statement of the Poisson paradigm, there are other versions in which the number of events is random and unknown.  

```{example}

Use Poisson approximation to approximate that probability that at least *three* people in a group of $n$ people share a birthday.  How large does $n$ need to be for the probability to be greater than 0.5?

```


```{asis fold.chunk = TRUE}

There are $\binom{n}{3}$ triples of people.  We showed in Example \@ref(exm:birthday-poisson) that the probability that any three people share a birthday is $\frac{1}{365^2}$.  If $X$ is the number of triples that share a birthday, then $\E(X) = \binom{n}{3}\left(\frac{1}{365^2}\right)$.  The number of trials is large and the probability of success on any trial is small, so we assume $X$ has an approximate Poisson distribution.  Therefore, the probability that at least three people share a birthday is
\[
1 - \IP(X=0) \approx   1-\exp\left(-\binom{n}{3}\left(\frac{1}{365^2}\right)\right)
\]
The smallest $n$ for which this probability is greater than 0.5 is $n=84$.  For $n\ge 124$, the probability is at least 0.9.

## Comparison of Distributions of Counts
  
The following table summarizes the four distributions we have seen that are used to model counting random variables.  Note that Poisson distributions require the weakest assumptions.

| Distribution      | Number of trials                                 | Number of successes   | Independent trials? | Probability of success                                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binomial          | Fixed and known ($n$)                            | Random ($X$)          | Yes                 | Fixed and known ($p$), <br> same for each trial                                      |
| Negative Binomial | Random ($X$)                                     | Fixed and known ($r$) | Yes                 | Fixed and known ($p$), <br> same for each trial                                      |
| Hypergeometric    | Fixed and known ($n$)                            | Random ($X$)          | No                  | Fixed and known ($p = \frac{N_1}{N_1+N_0}$), <br> same for each trial                |
| Poisson           | “Large” (could be random, <br> could be unknown) | Random ($X$)          | “Not too dependent" | “Comparably small for all trials" <br> (could vary between trials, could be unknown) |
